3</span>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are in Spain, according to
Antillon&rsquo;s <a name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a> calculations, two hundred thousand
ecclesiastics.&nbsp; They possess immense revenues and an
incalculable influence over the mass of the people; though it is
certain that influence is diminishing, notwithstanding the
countenance and co-operation of a government deeply interested in
preserving their authority.</p>
<p>It would be great injustice to the regular clergy of Spain to
class them with the immense hordes of monks and friars, scattered
over the face of the Peninsula, some possessing rich and
well-stored convents, large estates and accumulating wealth, and
others (the mendicant orders) who prey more directly on the
labours of the poor, and compel the industrious to administer to
their holy, uninterrupted laziness.&nbsp; The former, though,
doubtless, by far too numerous, are for the most part intelligent
and humane: dispensing benevolence and consolation in their
respective parishes; friendly, in many instances, to liberty and
devoted to literature.&nbsp; The latter, with few, but striking
exceptions, <a name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a> are unmanageable masses of ignorance
and indolence. <a name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c"
class="citation">[3c]</a>&nbsp; They live (as one of the Spanish
poets says) in a state of sensual enjoyment between the
organ-loft and the refectory, to which all other enjoyment is but
purgatory; <a name="citation3d"></a><a href="#footnote3d"
class="citation">[3d]</a> the link which should <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>connect them
with the common weal for ever broken; the ties of family and
friend dissolved; their authority founded on the barbarism and
degradation of the people, they are interested in stemming the
torrent of improvement in knowledge and liberty, which must in
the end inevitably sweep away these &ldquo;cumberers of the
soil.&rdquo;&nbsp; No society in which the sound principles of
policy are at all understood, would consent to maintain a
numerous body of idle, unproductive, useless members in opulence
and luxury, (at the expense of the active and the laborious,)
merely because they had chosen to decorate themselves with
peculiar insignia&mdash;to let their beards grow, or to shave
their heads; and though the progress of civilization in Spain has
been greatly retarded, or rather it has been compelled to
retrograde under the present system of despotism, yet, that great
advances have been made since the beginning of the late
Revolution, is happily too obvious to be denied. <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a></p>
<p>That Revolution, in fact, has produced, and will continue to
produce, a very favourable influence on the ecclesiastical
government of Spain.&nbsp; Leaving out of consideration the
immense number of priests and friars who perished during the
atrocious invasion of their country, the destruction of convents,
the alienation of church property, and the not unfrequent
abandonment of the religious vow, unnoticed amidst the confusion
and calamities of active war, more silent, but more extensive
changes have been going on.&nbsp; The Cortes, when they decreed
that no Noviciates should be allowed to enrol themselves, <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> gave a death-blow to the monastic
influence, and since the re-establishment of the ancient
despotism, the chasm left by this want of supply has not been
filled up, nor is likely to be; for, the greater part of the
convents (except those very richly endowed) complain that few
candidates propose themselves, except from the lower classes of
society, who are not likely to maintain the credit or add to the
influence of the order.&nbsp; Examples are now extremely rare of
men of family and fortune presenting themselves to be received
within the cloisters, and offering all their wealth and power as
the price of their admission.&nbsp; Another circumstance, the
consequence of the Revolution, has tended greatly to lessen the
influence of the regular clergy, where it is most desirable it
should be lessened, among the lower classes.&nbsp; Driven from
their cells by the bayonets of <i>enemies</i>, or obliged to
desert them that their convents might become hospitals for their
sick and wounded <i>friends</i>, they were compelled to mingle
with the mass of the people.&nbsp; To know them better was to
esteem them less, and the mist of veneration with which popular
prejudice had so long surrounded them, was dispersed, when they
became divested of every outward distinction, and exhibited the
same follies and frailties as their fellow-men. <a
name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a>&nbsp; He who, in the imposing
procession, or at the illumined altar, appeared a saint or a
prophet, was little, was nothing, when mingling in the common
relations of life he stood unveiled before his undazzled
observers.&nbsp; For the first time it was discovered that the
monks were not absolutely necessary for the preservation even of
religion.&nbsp; Masses were <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>celebrated as before: the host paraded
the streets with its accustomed pomp and solemnity: the
interesting ceremonials which accompany the entrance and the exit
of a human being in this valley of vicissitude, were all
conducted with their wonted regularity.&nbsp; Still less were
they wanted to implore the blessing of Heaven on the labours of
the husbandman, whose fruits grew and were gathered in with
unvarying abundance.&nbsp; Without <i>them</i> the country was
freed from the ignoble and degrading yoke of the usurper, while
success and martial glory crowned the arms of their military
companions, (the British,) who cared little for &ldquo;all the
trumpery&rdquo; of &ldquo;friars white, black, or grey;&rdquo;
and if the contagion of their contempt did not reach their
Catholic friends, they lessened, at least, the respect with which
the inmates of the convent had been so long regarded.</p>
<p>But in anticipating a period in which the Spaniard shall be
released from monkish influence, it must not be forgotten how
interwoven is that influence with his most delightful
recollections and associations.&nbsp; His festivities, his
romerias, <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> his rural pastimes, are all connected
with, and dependent on the annual return of some
saint&rsquo;s-day, in honour of which he gives himself up to the
most unrestrained enjoyment.&nbsp; A mass is with him the
introductory scene to every species of gaiety, and a procession
of monks and friars forms a part of every picture on which his
memory most delights to dwell.&mdash;And a similar, though,
perhaps, a stronger impression is created on his mind by the
enthusiastic &ldquo;love of song,&rdquo; <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> so universal in Spain.&nbsp; He lives
and breathes in a land of poetry and fiction: he listens with
ever-glowing rapture to the Romanceros, <a
name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a> who celebrate the <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>feats of his
heroes, and surround his monks and hermits with all the glories
of saints and angels: he hears of their mighty works, their
sufferings, their martyrdom; and the tale, decorated with the
charms of verse, is dearer to him than the best of holy
writ.&nbsp; The peculiar favourites of the spotless Virgin, their
words fall on his ear like the voice of an oracle, their deeds
have the solemn sanction of marvellous miracles.&nbsp; To them he
owes that his country is the special charge of the queen of
angels, the mother of God; and in every convent he sees the
records of the wondrous interpositions of heaven, which has so
often availed itself of the agency of the <i>sainted</i> inmates,
while every altar is adorned with the grateful offerings of
devout worshipers, miraculously restored to health or preserved
from danger.&nbsp; He feels himself the most privileged among the
faithful.&nbsp; On him &ldquo;our Lady of Protection&rdquo; (del
Amparo) smiles; to him the Virgin of Carmen <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> bows her gracious head.&nbsp; In his
eye ten thousand rays of glory encircle the brow of his
patron-saint, the fancied tones of whose voice support, assure
and encourage him: he believes that his scapulary <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> (blessed by a Carmelite friar) secures
him from every evil: his house is adorned with the pope&rsquo;s
bull of indulgences&mdash;a vessel of holy water is suspended
over his bed, and what more can he want, what danger can approach
him?&nbsp; His mind is one mass of undistinguishing, confiding,
comforting faith.&nbsp; <i>That</i> faith is his religion, his
Christianity!&nbsp; How difficult will it be to separate the evil
from the good, if, indeed, they can be separated!&nbsp; What a
fortress must be overthrown before truth and reason can advance a
single step!&nbsp; What delightful visions must be forgotten,
what animating recollections, what transporting hopes!&nbsp; Have
we a <i>right</i> to rouse him from these blessed
delusions?&nbsp; This is indeed the ignorance that is
bliss.&nbsp; Is it not folly to wish him wise?</p>
<p>But, alas! this is only one side of the picture! for, however
soothing, however charming the contemplation of contented
ignorance may be to the imagination, in the eye of reason the
moral influence of such a system is baneful in the extreme.&nbsp;
All error is evil; and the error which substitutes the external
forms of worship for its internal influence on the heart, is a
colossal evil.&nbsp; Here we have a religion, if such it may be
called, that is purely ceremonial.&nbsp; Its duties are not
discharged in the daily walk of life, not by the cultivation of
pure and pious and benevolent affections, but by attending
masses, by reciting Paternosters and Ave Marias, by pecuniary
offerings for souls in purgatory, and by a thousand childish
observances, which affect remotely, if they affect at all, the
conduct and the character.&nbsp; The Spaniard attends his parish
church to hear a service in an unknown tongue; <a
name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c"
class="citation">[6c]</a> he bends his knees and beats his bosom
at certain sounds familiar to his ear, but not to his sense; he
confesses and communicates with undeviating regularity; <a
name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d"
class="citation">[6d]</a> and sometimes, perhaps, he listens to a
sermon in the eloquent style and beautiful language of his
country, not, indeed, instructing him in the moral claims of his
religion, but celebrating <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the virtues and recounting the
miracles of some saint or martyr to whom the day is
dedicated.&nbsp; He reads his religious duties, not in a Bible,
but an Almanack; and his Almanack is but a sort of Christian
mythology.&nbsp; His saints are more numerous than the deities of
the pantheon; and, to say the truth, there are many of them
little better than these. <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a></p>
<p>He is told, however, that his country exhibits the proudest
triumphs of orthodox Christianity.&nbsp; Schism and heresy have
been scattered, or at least silenced: and if in Spain the eye is
constantly attracted, and the heart distressed, by objects of
unalleviated human misery; if the hospitals are either wholly
unprotected, or abandoned to the care of the venal and the vile;
if the prisons are crowded with a promiscuous mass of innocence
and guilt, in all its shades and shapes of enormity <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&mdash;what does it matter?&nbsp; Spain,
Catholic Spain, has preserved her faith unadulterated and
unchanged, and her priests assure us that an error in creed is
far more dangerous, (or to use their own mild language,) far more
damnable, than a multitude of errors in conduct.&nbsp; A depraved
heart may be forgiven, but not an erring head.&nbsp; This is, in
fact, the fatal principle, whose poison spreads through this
strongly-cemented system.&nbsp; To this we may attribute its
absurdities, its errors, its crimes.&nbsp; This has created
Dominicks and Torquemadas.</p>
<p>In a word, intolerance, in its widest and worst extent, is the
foundation on which the whole of the Spanish ecclesiastical
edifice rests.&nbsp; It has been called the main pillar of the
constitution, and is so inwrought with the habits and prejudices
of the nation, that the Cortes, with all their general
liberality, dared not allow the profession of any other religion
than the &ldquo;Catolica Apostolica Romana unica
Verdadera.&rdquo; <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; The cry of <i>innovation</i>
there, as elsewhere, became a dreadful weapon in the hands of
those who profess to believe that errors become sanctified by
age.&nbsp; Too true it is, that if long usage can sanction wrong,
persecution might find its justification in every page of Spanish
history, from the time when Recaredo, the gothic monarch,
abandoned his Arian principles (with the almost solitary
exception of the tolerant and ill-treated Witiza).&nbsp; Long,
long before the Inquisition had erected its frightful pretensions
into a system, or armed itself with its bloody sword, its spirit
was abroad and active.&nbsp; Thousands and tens of thousands of
Jews and Moors had been its victims, and its founders did no more
than obtain a regal or a papal licence, for the murders which
would otherwise have been probably committed by a barbarous and
frenzied mob, excited by incendiary monks and friars.</p>
<p>The Inquisition has, no doubt, been greatly humanized by the
progress of time; as, in order to maintain its influence in these
more enlightened and inquiring days, it has availed itself of men
of superior talent, these have softened the asperity, or
controlled the malignity and petty tyranny of its inferior
agents.&nbsp; Its vigilance and its persecutions are, indeed,
continually at work, yet, I believe its <i>flames</i> will never
again be lighted.&nbsp; Its greatest zeal is now directed against
Freemasons, of whom immense numbers occupy its prisons and
dungeons.&nbsp; I have conversed with many who have been
incarcerated by the Inquisition, and they agree in stating that
torture is no longer administered. <a name="citation7d"></a><a
href="#footnote7d" class="citation">[7d]</a>&nbsp; But its <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>influence on
literature is perhaps greater than ever; for though Spain
possesses at the present moment a great number of admirable
writers, the press was never so inactive.&nbsp; The despotism
exercised over authors <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> and publishers is so
intolerable, that few have courage voluntarily to submit to
it.&nbsp; Often after authorizing the publication of a work, they
order it to be suppressed, and every copy to be burnt, and never
think of reparation to those who are so cruelly injured.&nbsp;
Their presumption in condemning whatever they cannot understand,
<a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> their domiciliary visits, their
arbitrary decrees, against which there is no security and no
appeal, make them fearful enemies and faithless friends.</p>
<p>With the difficulty, delay, expense and frequent impossibility
of obtaining a licence for the publication of any valuable work,
may be well contrasted the ridiculous trash which daily issues
from the Spanish press.&nbsp; Accounts of miracles wrought by the
different virgins, <a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a> lives of holy friars and sainted nuns,
romances of marvellous conversions, libels against Jews <a
name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a> <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and heretics and Freemasons, histories
of apparitions, and so forth, are generally introduced, not by a
mere licence of the inquisitor, but by long and laboured
eulogiums.</p>
<p>It is no novel observation, that the most cruel and intolerant
persecutors have often been men wholly devoid of religious
principle; men, who consider the religion of the state only as a
part of its civil policy, and who treat the denial of a national
creed with the same severity as the infraction of an established
law, or rather as a species of treason against the supreme
authority.&nbsp; No plea of modest inquiry, of conscientious
doubt, or honest difference of opinion, is allowed to oppose for
a moment their sanguinary and despotic sway.&nbsp; There are no
terms of safety but those of unresisting, instant, absolute
prostration.&nbsp; Such men are generally the prime movers of the
gagging engine of religious intolerance; and such men are to be
found too abundantly in Spain.&nbsp; Others there are who imagine
they see in the pomp and parade of the Romish ritual, a system of
delusion admirably adapted to beguile, or even to bless the
ignorant.&nbsp; They fancy themselves beings of a higher and
nobler order, and that, while they bask in the sunshine of
intellect and knowledge, they may be well content that the
uninstructed mass should trudge on in darkness below.&nbsp; Why
should they throw their pearls to senseless swine; or shower down
truth and virtue on those who fatten on vice and error?</p>
<p>But perhaps a larger class, which would include too the
majority of the learned clergy of Spain, are they whose honest
opinions are made up of heresy and infidelity; but their worldly
interests are so inwrought with the existing system, that the
thought of sacrificing those interests to the higher claims of
right, has never occurred to them; or, if it has occurred, has
never obtained a moment&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; To them it is a
glorious and gold-giving superstition.&nbsp; If they can persuade
themselves that, on the whole, it is harmless, they are
satisfied.&nbsp; They do more&mdash;they say it is beneficial,
and they have repeated this so often, that they, perhaps, almost
believe it is true.&nbsp; Would they look round them they might
see the melancholy effects which superstition and intolerance
have produced in their hapless country.&nbsp; What is
Seville&mdash;the once renowned Seville, with its hundred and
twenty-five churches and convents?&nbsp; The very shrine of
ignorance.&nbsp; It was there that the Spanish chart of liberty
was trampled under foot, amidst ten thousand shouts of
&ldquo;Live the King and the Inquisition!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perish the Constitution!&rdquo;&nbsp; Or Cordoba, so long
the cradle of the arts, the favourite seat of retiring
wisdom?&nbsp; It is become the chosen abode of vice and
barbarism!&nbsp; The press, which was established there in the
short era of Spanish liberty, has been torn in pieces by a
frantic mob, who, excited by the monks, paraded the streets of
this unfortunate capital, threatening death to every individual
whose name had been connected with that of liberty.&nbsp; How
many a town and city, once illustrious, has sunk into
nothingness! <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;What remains of their
ancient glory?&nbsp; The ruins of palaces, of fabrics, of
store-houses and dwellings; and undilapidated churches and
monasteries and hospitals, outliving the misery of which they
have been the cause.&rdquo; <a name="citation9b"></a><a
href="#footnote9b" class="citation">[9b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>One
might surely expect that in a country possessing eight
archbishops, more than fifty bishops, and more than a hundred
abbacies, with a jurisdiction almost episcopal; &ldquo;in
which,&rdquo; to use the language of a Spanish writer,
&ldquo;there are more churches than houses, more altars than
hearths, more priests than peasants;&rdquo; in which every
dwelling has its saint, and every individual his
scapulary;&mdash;one might expect to see some benefits, some
blessings resulting from this gigantic mass of ecclesiastical
influence.&nbsp; Let us, then, look upon a picture drawn by the
hand of an acknowledged master.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our universities <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> are the faithful depositaries of the
prejudices of the middle age; our teachers, doctors of the tenth
century.&nbsp; Beardless noviciates instruct us in the sublime
mysteries of our faith; mendicant friars in the profound secrets
of philosophy; while barbarous monks explain the nice
distinctions of metaphysics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes into our streets without meeting cofradias, <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> processions or rosaries; without
hearing the shrill voice of eunuchs, <a name="citation10c"></a><a
href="#footnote10c" class="citation">[10c]</a> the braying of
sacristans, the confused sound of sacred music, entertaining and
instructing the devout with compositions so exalted, and imagery
so romantic, that devotion itself is forced into a smile?&nbsp;
In the corners of our squares, at the doors of our houses, the
mysterious truths of our religion are commented on by blind
beggars to the discordant accompaniment of an untuned
guitar.&nbsp; Our walls are papered with records of
&lsquo;authentic miracles,&rsquo; compared to which, the
metamorphoses of Ovid are natural and credible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ignorance has been the parent, not of superstition
alone, but of incredulity and infidelity.&nbsp; The Bible, the
argument and evidence of our Christian faith, has been shamefully
abandoned, or cautiously buried beneath piles of decretals,
formularies, puerile meditations, and fabulous histories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monkish influence has given to the dreams and deliriums
of foolish women, or crafty men, the authority of revealed
truth.&nbsp; Our friars have pretended to repair with their
rotten and barbarous scaffolding, the eternal edifice of the
gospel.&nbsp; They have twisted and tortured the moral law into a
thousand monstrous forms, to suit their passions and their
interests.&nbsp; Now they describe the path to heaven as plain
and easy,&mdash;now it is difficult,&mdash;to morrow they will
call it impassable.&nbsp; They have dared to obscure with their
artful commentaries the beautiful simplicity of the Word of
God.&nbsp; They have darkened the plainest truths of revelation,
and on the hallowed charter of Christian liberty, they have even
erected the altar of civil despotism!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fictions and falsehoods they have invented to
deceive their followers, in their pretended visions and spurious
miracles, they have even ventured to compromise the terrible
majesty of heaven.&nbsp; They shew us our Saviour lighting one
nun to put cakes into an oven; throwing oranges at another from
the <i>sagrario</i>; tasting different dishes in the
convent-kitchens, and tormenting friars with childish and
ridiculous playfulness.&nbsp; They represent a monk gathering
together the fragments of a broken bottle, and depositing in it
the spilt wine, to console a child who had let it fall at the
door of the wine-shop.&nbsp; Another, repeating the miracle of
Cana to satisfy the brotherhood, and a third restoring a
still-born chicken to life that some inmate of the convent might
not be disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They represent to us a man preserving his speech many
years after death, in order to confess his sins; another throwing
himself from a high balcony without danger, that he might go to
mass.&nbsp; A dreadful fire instantly extinguished by a scapulary
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of
Estamene.&nbsp; They shew us the Virgin feeding a monk from her
own bosom; angels habited like friars, chanting the matins of the
convent, because the friars were asleep.&nbsp; They paint the
meekest and holiest of men torturing and murdering the best and
the wisest for professing a different religious creed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have indeed much <i>religion</i>, but no Christian
charity.&nbsp; We hurry with our pecuniary offerings to advance
any <i>pious work</i>, but we do not scruple to defraud our
fellow-men.&nbsp; We confess every month, but our vices last us
our lives.&nbsp; We insist (almost exclusively) on the name of
Christians, while our conduct is worse than that of
infidels.&nbsp; In one concluding word, we fear the dark dungeon
of the inquisition, but not the awful&mdash;the tremendous
tribunal of God!&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p>This is the representation of a Spaniard.&nbsp; Though the
colouring is high, it is a copy from nature, and the shades might
have been heightened had he witnessed the conduct of numbers of
the monastic orders during the late convulsions of Spain.&nbsp;
There are, indeed, few examples of such infamous want of
principle as was exhibited by many of them on the king&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; Those who had gone about preaching the rights of
man, proclaiming the wisdom and exalting the blessings of the new
constitution; exhorting their hearers, often with a vehemence
little becoming their situation, to live and die for its
preservation, and hurling their bitterest anathemas against those
who dared to question the wisdom of a single article,&mdash;when
the king refused to sign that constitution, became the eulogists
of every act of tyranny, the persecutors of the <i>liberales</i>,
and the chosen friends of Ferdinand. <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; They have
had their reward: and though a few of them have occupied the
vacant sees, and have been caressed and recompensed <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>with no
sparing hand, the finger of hatred and of scorn points them out
to the execration of betrayed and suffering millions, while their
names will go down to posterity, accompanied with reproaches,
curses and infamy.&nbsp; If those be forgiven who have gone on in
one consistent career of servitude and degradation; who have
betrayed no cause of liberty&mdash;for they are by habit and by
election slaves; who have sacrificed no manly
principles&mdash;for manly principles they had none;&mdash;still
no charity can wash away the stains of those traitors to freedom,
to humanity, to Spain, who so atrociously deserted the banners of
their country&rsquo;s welfare, to range themselves around the
standards of a profligate and unexampled tyranny.</p>
<p>The most notorious of those, however, who co-operated to
establish that fatal and ferocious despotism which now degrades
and oppresses Spain, have already become its victims.&nbsp; In
their sorrow and suffering and exile, let the unshaken friends of
constitutional liberty, who are scattered over Europe, console
themselves with remembering that their personal fate is no more
severe than that of the base tools of a wretched monarch, who
have nothing to accompany their wanderings but sadness, shame and
self-reproach, dark and barren prospects, and desolate
remembrances; while <i>those</i> shall receive from all around
them, the smiles and the praises of the wise and good.&nbsp; They
may look back on the &ldquo;bread&rdquo; of virtue which they
have &ldquo;cast on the waters,&rdquo; and forward in the
confident hope that they &ldquo;shall find it again after many
days:&rdquo; but they who sacrificed their country to their
cold-hearted and selfish avarice, have wholly erred in their
calculations.&nbsp; Their country is fallen indeed, but they,
too, have been buried in its ruins.&nbsp; Ferdinand, who has just
as much of gratitude as of any other virtue, <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> has already trampled on the miserable
tools of his early tyranny.&nbsp; It were well if those who
&ldquo;put their trust in princes,&rdquo; would study the many
impressive lessons which the reign of the Spanish tyrant
affords.</p>
<p>It is consolatory to turn from the profligacy and vice so
often prominent amidst extraordinary political revolutions, to
the spirit of truth and liberty which they always elicit; and
Spain has had a most triumphant list of patriots.&nbsp; Their
names must not be recorded: for, to receive the tribute of
affection and gratitude from any hater of a tyrant, would be
sufficient <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>to subject them to his merciless ferocity.&nbsp; How
wretched that country where no meed of applause may follow the
track of talent or of virtue&mdash;where knowledge and the love
of freedom are pursued and persecuted as if they were curses and
crimes!&nbsp; Otherwise, with what delight should I speak of some
who, buried in the obscurity of the cloister, or retiring into
solitude from the noisy crowd, sigh in secret and silence over
the wretched fate of the land of their birth, their admirable
powers of body and mind fettered and frozen by the hand of
despotism!&nbsp; All around them is slavery and ignorance; to
them remain alone the joy of holding converse with the wise and
the good of departed time, and the ecstatic hope that their
country will one day burst from its death-like slumbers, and
spring forth &ldquo;into liberty and life and light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And let those illustrious exiles, the martyrs of truth and
freedom, who have been driven by an ungrateful and cruel tyrant
from their homes and their country, and doomed &ldquo;to wander
through this miserable world,&rdquo; take heart; for a brighter
and better day is about to dawn upon Spain.&nbsp; I have
expressed a hope, it should rather be a conviction, that this
period cannot linger long.&nbsp; If the extreme of evil brings
with it its own remedy; if human endurance will only support a
certain weight of despotism; if &ldquo;there is a spirit in
man;&rdquo; if there is a strength in virtue or in
liberty&mdash;the intolerable fetters <i>must</i> be broken.</p>
<blockquote><p>&iquest;Que es esto, Autor eterno<br />
Del triste mundo? tu sublime nombre<br />
Que en el se ultraja &aacute; moderar no alcanzas?<br />
&mdash;&iquest; &aacute; infelices venganzas<br />
Y sangre y muerte has destinado el hombre?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &iquest;A tantas desventuras<br />
Ningnu termino pones?&nbsp; &iquest;&oacute; el odioso<br />
Monstruo por siempre triunfar&aacute; orgulloso?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Melendez</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The object, for which the foregoing observations were written,
made it necessary to exclude some particulars, which perhaps
deserve record.</p>
<p>A correct idea of the state of learning in Spain might be
formed from the general decline of the public <i>colegios</i> and
universities, and the almost universal ignorance of those to whom
the important business of education is intrusted.&nbsp; At
Alcal&aacute; de Henares, where there were formerly four or five
thousand students, there are now less than three hundred, and the
number is yearly declining.&nbsp; A similar decay may be observed
elsewhere.&nbsp; I found every thing in a melancholy state of
derangement and dilapidation at Bergara, though this, I believe,
is now the only public school which has been able to maintain
itself.&nbsp; The philosophical and mathematical instruments had
been destroyed by rust, or rendered useless by violence, and
every thing connected with instruction appeared conducted as if
the dreadful apprehension that <i>too much</i> wisdom might be
communicated, were constantly present to the <i>enlightened</i>
directors.</p>
<p>There are few objects more touching, more humiliating, than
those scenes sacred once to liberty and to literature, and
associated with the names of the noblest and &ldquo;the wisest of
our race;&rdquo; but now become the fortresses of ignorance,
profligacy and despotism.&nbsp; Who would not sigh over
Cordoba?</p>
<blockquote><p>When I remember what thou wert of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Birth-place of Senecas;&mdash;nurse of arms and
arts;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to thy schools from earth&rsquo;s remotest
parts<br />
The nations crowded&mdash;while thy sons unroll&rsquo;d<br />
Thy chronicles of wisdom;&mdash;when I see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The spot Averr&ouml;es lov&rsquo;d, and tread the
sod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Maimonides and Abenezra trod;<br />
Or seek the umbrage of some rev&rsquo;rend tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath whose shade Mena or Cespedes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon-tide mus&rsquo;d:&mdash;when I remember
these<br />
Or other hallow&rsquo;d names, and see thee <i>now</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrouded in ignorance and slavery:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O Cordoba! my spirit weeps o&rsquo;er thee,<br />
And burning blushes kindle on my brow. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>While
the majority of the most distinguished writers of Spain have been
expatriated, it may be supposed literature is at a very low ebb
there.&nbsp; Melendez and Est&aacute;la have died in
exile,&mdash;while Moratin and Llorente will probably never again
revisit their native land.&nbsp; Marina, Quintana,
Arg&uuml;elles, Gallego, and other estimable men, occupy the
hopeless dungeons to which tyranny has consigned them; while this
island, in particular, has had the honour of welcoming and of
sheltering many a generous patriot and many an enlightened
scholar, whose virtues and talents are lost to a country which
has so much reason to deplore their removal.</p>
<p>I trust, however, that a work which has been so long a
desideratum, viz. a History of Spain under the dominion of the
Moors, compiled from Arabic documents, will, ere long, be
published, by Don Jos&eacute; Antonio Conde, the learned
Orientalist, whose erudition and diligent research promise a most
valuable and interesting narration.</p>
<p>The Spanish Academy are now printing, at Madrid, a new edition
of Don Quixote, in five volumes, which will be prefaced by a Life
of Cervantes, by Navarrete.&nbsp; This piece of biography will be
peculiarly gratifying, as many documents connected with the
history of Cervantes have lately been discovered, especially the
records of the proceedings against him, before his imprisonment.
<a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>Herrera&rsquo;s celebrated work on Agriculture is also being
printed by the Academy.&nbsp; The biographical notices are
written by Don Mariano Lagasca, whose name is a sufficient pledge
for their excellence.</p>
<p>The Spanish Drama had been in a progressive state of decay
from the death of Candamo, till Moratin&rsquo;s <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> attempts to introduce the regularity
and unity of the Parisian theatre were <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>crowned with complete success.&nbsp;
It is a different, and will be considered as a lower order of
merit, by all who place Nature and Shakespeare above Art and the
French Drama.&nbsp; If, however, Calderon and Lope, Moreto and
Montalvan, Solis and Candamo, seldom occupy the Spanish stage, it
is because the national taste, or the national indifference, has
chosen to sanction or permit the puerile trifles imported from
the other side of the Pyrenees, to occupy the seats which might
be so much more honourably filled by native genius.&nbsp; An
active controversy is going on as to the respective merits of the
French and Spanish theatres; but it does not seem to excite much
interest beyond the immediate circle of combatants.&nbsp; A new
dramatic writer (Gorostiza <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a>) has lately
appeared, and his first effort, &ldquo;Indulgencia para
todos,&rdquo; in spite of some improbabilities in the story, and
some vulgarisms in the style, gives fair hopes for the
future.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, I would remark, that ultra-royalism and
bigotry may receive from the present wretchedness of Spain a
<i>salutary</i> and <i>corrective</i> lesson.&nbsp; They may
there see the unalloyed triumph of their principles, and study
the consequences in the degradation, the disquietude and the
wretchedness of a once renowned and illustrious nation.&nbsp;
They have there a king reigning in &ldquo;all the glory&rdquo; of
uncontrolled majesty, and a state-religion undisturbed by
heretics or schismatics;&mdash;there is the dull death-like
silence of abhorred submission, unbroken by any hated shouts of
liberty&mdash;&ldquo;the prostration of the understanding and the
will,&rdquo; that neither dares nor wishes to inquire.</p>
<p>As to the character of Ferdinand, it has been greatly
misunderstood or <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>greatly misrepresented.&nbsp; It has been well said of
him, that he has all the crimes and none of the merits of his
ancestors.&nbsp; He appears to care little about the church or
the clergy, except inasmuch as he can make them the instruments
of civil despotism. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; His habits are
gross and licentious; yet he is inaccessible to any sentiment of
benevolence or generosity.&mdash;He never forgave a fancied
enemy, and perhaps he never possessed a real friend.&mdash;From
his very childhood his untameable and barbarous propensities made
him the object of fear and dread; and adversity (that touchstone
of character) has served only to excite and heighten the dark
ferocity of his disposition.&nbsp; What, indeed, could be
expected from an ingrate, who rewarded those that replaced in his
worthless hand the sceptre he had cast away, with persecution and
exile, imprisonment and death?</p>
<blockquote><p>Was it for this through seven long years of war<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We bore the miserable wants of woes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour&rsquo;d on our naked heads by barb&rsquo;rous
foes,<br />
While thou a patient captive&mdash;absent far,<br />
Nor heard&rsquo;st our cries, nor saw&rsquo;st the bloody star<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That o&rsquo;er our helpless, hapless country
rose?<br />
Did we not break the intolerable bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forged by the master-tyrant?&nbsp; Interpose<br />
To rescue&mdash;not our country&mdash;but mankind?<br />
Did we not break thy prison-doors, unbind<br />
Thy fetters, and with shouts of joy that rent<br />
The very arches of the firmament<br />
Receive thee?&mdash;And is this our destiny?<br />
Insults and slavery, and a wretch like thee!</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote3a"></a><a href="#citation3a"
class="footnote">[3a]</a>&nbsp; Antillon&mdash;I cannot mention
this illustrious name without a tribute of admiration and
gratitude.&nbsp; A life devoted to virtue and literature, an
unwearied struggle in the cause of civil and religious liberty,
rewarded by the fatal blow of a hired assassin, leaves behind it
an impress on the hearts of the generous and the good which will
not and cannot be erased.</p>
<p><a name="footnote3b"></a><a href="#citation3b"
class="footnote">[3b]</a>&nbsp; It cannot be denied that the
seclusion of the convent is so friendly to contemplation and
research, that, literature has been, and still is, greatly
indebted to it.&nbsp; A glance at the columns of Nich.
Antonio&rsquo;s Biographical Dictionary will give striking proof
of this.</p>
<p><a name="footnote3c"></a><a href="#citation3c"
class="footnote">[3c]</a>&nbsp; There are many convents in which
no book could be found but the service of mass or the rules of
the order.&nbsp; In others, there are excellent libraries, of
whose value friars have no idea whatever.&nbsp; In the convent of
San Miguel de los Reyes, near Valencia, I examined some of the
most interesting MSS. in existence, which are in charge of a
brotherhood of unlearned Geronomites.&nbsp; The librarian refused
to shew me a celebrated MS. of the Roman de la Rose,
&ldquo;because&rdquo; (he said) &ldquo;it was the work of a
heretic;&rdquo; though he added, he had written some verses in it
to frighten any inquirer who might accidentally open it.&nbsp; He
had been recommending <i>the burning</i> a noble illuminated MS.
of the &ldquo;Divina Commedia,&rdquo; apparently contemporary
with Dante, as &ldquo;the wretch had dared to send even Popes to
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ancient copies of Virgil, Livy and others, are
in some danger, should our zealous friar stumble on their
history, and learn that they never went to mass.</p>

<blockquote><p>Es Purgatorio&mdash;<br />
Toda dicha, comparada<br />

Desde el coro al refectorio.</p>

<p>The whole description is admirable, and I am tempted to
introduce it here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friend, thou art right!&nbsp; A world like this<br
/>
Hath nothing equal to the bliss<br />
Enjoyed by yonder lazy friar,<br />
Between refectory and choir!<br />
The morning pass&rsquo;d in sacred song,<br />
(The task is short&mdash;the triumph long!)<br />
Why should our portly friar repine?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough for him&mdash;good man! to see<br />
His cellar stor&rsquo;d with rosy wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His table pil&rsquo;d with luxury.<br />
Come now, come with me, and partake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our friar&rsquo;s <i>poor</i> and <i>modest</i>
board:<br />
Meek sufferer&mdash;for Jesus&rsquo; sake!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-sacrific&rsquo;d&mdash;to please the Lord!!<br
/>
And is this rich and gay domain<br />
His place of penury and pain?<br />
That table <i>his</i>, where rang&rsquo;d in state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see so many jovial brothers,<br />
Each with his fingers in his plate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his eyes fix&rsquo;d upon another&rsquo;s?<br />
O &rsquo;tis indeed a lovely sight<br />
To see thus earth and heav&rsquo;n unite;<br />
And what an enviable union<br />
Of church and kitchen in communion!<br />
While, hark! a voice at intervals,<br />
The <i>pious</i> grace devoutly bawls<br />
Gratias tibi, Domine!<br />
While up and down their arms are moving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like engines in a factory:<br />
Thus most indisputably proving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How calm and meek and patiently<br />
These pious souls submit to all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>sorrow</i>, <i>suff&rsquo;ring</i> and
<i>privation</i><br />
Which may an earthly saint befal:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O unexampled resignation!!</p>

recalled Jesuits: they came&mdash;not the learned, the
illustrious fathers of former days, but a handful of ignorant,
helpless old men, incapable of good, and, I trust, incapable of
evil.&nbsp; Father Juan Andres died in Rome in 1817.</p>
<p><a name="footnote4b"></a><a href="#citation4b"
class="footnote">[4b]</a>&nbsp; They enacted this under the
pretence that all young men were wanted for the defence of the
country.&nbsp; Even the friars were obliged to be silent against
such a plea.</p>
<p><a name="footnote4c"></a><a href="#citation4c"
class="footnote">[4c]</a>&nbsp; Nor are there wanting instances
of friars atoning on the scaffold for crimes of the deepest dye;
and I could mention examples of fraud, violence and murder
committed since the king&rsquo;s return by individuals among
them, whose monstrous atrocity it would be difficult to
parallel.</p>
<p><a name="footnote5a"></a><a href="#citation5a"
class="footnote">[5a]</a>&nbsp; Romerias.&nbsp; That these acts
of devotion are always attended with shameful profligacy is
sufficiently known.&nbsp; Even Calderon bears testimony to their
danger:</p>

Tal vez en zelo empiezan<br />
Y acaban en delicia;<br />

<p><a name="footnote5b"></a><a href="#citation5b"
class="footnote">[5b]</a>&nbsp; The Roman Catholic Church has
made a glorious league with the fine arts, each of which has been
made subservient to its purposes, and has maintained its mighty
influence.&nbsp; Poetry, painting and music can never pay the
immense debt they owe to the gorgeous machinery of the Romish
ritual.</p>
<p><a name="footnote5c"></a><a href="#citation5c"

introduce a few specimens of the style of the Romanceros.&nbsp;
For instance, their praises of the Virgin:</p>

<p>Great, however, as is their devotion, it is less than their
bombast.</p>

an expression into a constitutional code could not be unnoticed
by the illustrious body of deputies, to whom the Cortes had

that they might effect hereafter some plans of ecclesiastical
reformation.</p>

class="footnote">[7d]</a>&nbsp; Torture has been abolished in
Spain for many years.&nbsp; However, that monster in the form of
man, Elio, the captain-general of Valencia, has dared to employ
it; and when I was in that capital I was informed, (and the fact
has had abundant confirmation,) that it had been applied a few
days before to no less than 147 individuals, whose cries and
shrieks were heard by all the inhabitants of Murviedro, where
they were confined.&nbsp; This tiger might allege, indeed, the
example of his royal master, who caused numbers to be tortured in
Madrid, after the last conspiracy there.</p>

suspicious that no allusion was made in it to the Sumo

instances of ignorance which I have individually witnessed.&nbsp;
As I did not choose to expose myself to be annoyed by
inquisitors, I travelled without any English books, except a
small collection of hymns.&nbsp; They pounced upon it at Miranda
del Ebro, where there is a rigid examination: there was some
dispute whether or not it should be condemned, when some word
like the name of a Spanish town, caught their eye: &ldquo;O,

believe &ldquo;our Lady of Montserrat,&rdquo; in Catalonia, and
&ldquo;our Lady of the Pillar,&rdquo; of Zaragoza, have amassed
for their guardian friars the largest piles of wealth.</p>
<p><a name="footnote8d"></a><a href="#citation8d"
class="footnote">[8d]</a>&nbsp; As an instance of the fraud, the
falsehood and the folly of those who sway the minds of the lower
classes, I would quote, from among many examples, the
&ldquo;Centinela contra Judios,&rdquo; a book of great
popularity, introduced by several pages of inquisitorial
praises.&nbsp; It gives the following account of the crimes and
punishments of the twelve tribes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tribe of Judah treacherously delivered
up our Lord, and thirty of them die by treason every year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Reuben seized our Lord in the garden, and
therefore the curse of barrenness is on all they sow or plant,
and no green thing can flourish over their graves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Gad put on the crown of thorns, and on
every 25th of March, their bodies are covered with blood from
deep and painful wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those of Asher buffeted Jesus, and their right hand is
always nearly a palm shorter than the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those of Naphthali jested with Christ about a herd of
swine, since when they are all born with tusks, like wild
boars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Manasseh cried out, &lsquo;His blood be on
us and on our children,&rsquo; and at every new moon they are
tormented by bloody sores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Simeon nailed our Lord to the cross, and
on the 25th of March, four deep and dreadful wounds are inflicted
on their hands and feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those of Levi spat on the Saviour, and the wind always
blows back their saliva in their faces, so that they are
habitually covered with filth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Issachar scourged Christ, and on the 25th
of March blood streams forth from their shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Zebulon cast lots for the garments, and on
the same day the roof of their mouth is tortured by deep
wounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tribe of Joseph made the nails for crucifying
Jesus, and blunted them to increase his sufferings; and therefore
their hands and feet are covered with gashes and blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those of Benjamin gave vinegar to Jesus; they all
squint and are palsied, and have their months filled with little
nauseous worms, which, in truth, (adds our author,) is the case
with all Jewish women after the age of 25, because it was a woman
who intreated the tribe of Joseph not to sharpen the nails used
for the crucifixion of our Lord.&rdquo;</p>

ecclesiastical authority is most active, have been the most

religious liberty.&nbsp; And these, too, are universally the most
barbarous of the Spanish cities.&nbsp; How the clergy at Santiago

<p>This recreant friar in a letter to the Patriarch of the

<p>Of Ferdinand: &ldquo;Nuestro idolatrado rey.&nbsp; Nuestro
suspirado monarca, el mas justo de los reyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of himself: &ldquo;Mi conducta me granje&oacute; el favor de

<p>Of the above sermon: &ldquo;Habl&eacute; con la ligereza y

</blockquote>
<p>Another disgraceful example may be quoted in that of Father
Velez, the present Bishop of Ceuta, who has lately published a
book, entitled Defensa del Altar y del Trono, so infamous, so
full of outrages, insults, and shameless mendacity, that the very
Inquisition refused to license its impression; and our mitred
libeller delivered a copy to the king, whose taste it so
admirably suited, that he issued an immediate mandate, signed by
his royal hand, ordering its instant publication.&nbsp; I believe
it is the only book which has been printed for years without the
Inquisition&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"
class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; The title of <i>Ingrato</i> is,
in fact, the Spanish despot&rsquo;s right <i>par
excellence</i>.&nbsp; A few more such examples would dissolve the
spell which holds so many slaves in bondage, and lead them to
doubt whether</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Such divinity</i> as doth hedge a
king,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>can really be of celestial origin.</p>
<p><a name="footnote13"></a><a href="#citation13"
class="footnote">[13]</a>&nbsp; I know of no city honoured with
so proud a list of illustrious men in so many departments of
literature, as Cordoba.&nbsp; Strabo (Cap. iii.) speaks of the
learning of its inhabitants, and so does Cicero (Orat. pro
Archi&acirc;).&nbsp; The two Senecas and Lucan among the Romans;
Averr&ouml;es; his rival Avicenna, and Abenzoar, distinguished
Arabic writers; the three most famous Hebrew Rabbies, Abenezra,
Kimki and Maimonides; Ferdinand the logician; Juan de Mena, the
father of Spanish poetry; Arias Montano, Nebrixa, Gongora, the
poet, and Cespedes, the every thing&mdash;were all natives of
Cordoba.&nbsp; Repeated attempts have been made to revive the
spirit of learning in this interesting capital, and the literary
societies there have published several striking appeals on the
subject; but Cordoba continues without even a bookseller&rsquo;s
stall;&mdash;a striking monument of the triumphs of monkery and
ignorance over all that is great, good and generous in the human
character.</p>
<p><a name="footnote14a"></a><a href="#citation14a"
class="footnote">[14a]</a>&nbsp; Notwithstanding the many
discussions as to the birth-place of Cervantes, and the numerous
copies that have been made of the register of his baptism, since
the claims of Alcal&aacute; to the honour of his birth-place have
been admitted, it is surprising that no one should have remarked
that the name of his father is spelt <i>Carvantes</i> in the
original parish record, which I consulted.&nbsp; It is in the
oldest of the registers of the church of St. Mary Mayor, at page
192.</p>
<p>Fray Jayme Villanueva mentioned a curious circumstance to me
at Valencia, connected with Cervantes;&mdash;that among the
ecclesiastical documents he had examined at Tarragona, there were
a great number of letters addressed to the Cabildo, relating
various acts of robbery and murder committed by Roque Guinart and
his band, (vide Don Quixote, Vol. IV. Par. ii. Cap. 60,) and
imploring their assistance to rid the country of these
freebooters: these letters are dated 1614.&nbsp; Now the second
part of Don Quixote was published in 1615.&nbsp; How soon did
Cervantes avail himself of these events, and how rapid must his
composition have been!</p>
<blockquote><p>Cervantes! idol of my happiest hours!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Generous and joyous spirit! who hast brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thy rich storehouse of romantic thought<br />
Wisdom and truth and valor!&mdash;All the powers<br />
Of Poetry and Music fill thy bowers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud is the monument thy hands have wrought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beautiful the lesson thou hast taught;&mdash;<br
/>
And now the muse of many nations showers<br />
Garlands upon thy tomb:&mdash;yet thou wert poor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And desolate in life&mdash;of all bereft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In misery and melancholy left<br />
To fix thy dim eye on a prison door!<br />
Shame on the world!&nbsp; No other star shall shine<br />
Upon that world with such a light as thine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se engendr&oacute; (el Quixote) en una carcel donde
toda incomodidad tiene su asiento y donde todo triste ruido hace
su habitacion.&rdquo;</p>

probably reached England, I shall be excused for introducing a
specimen of his verses from the above comedy.&nbsp; Take, for

and impatience.&nbsp; In the really interesting solemnities of
the 2nd of May, (to commemorate the earliest victims of the
Revolution,) in the presence of the Court, the Nuncio, and the
dignified ecclesiastics of Spain, he played idly with his wax
taper and his pocket handkerchief, and walked out of church in
the middle of mass.&nbsp; If he ever amused himself with
embroidering garments for the Virgin, (which I do not believe,)

his country, he has not thought it necessary to wear the mask of
hypocrisy any longer.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
